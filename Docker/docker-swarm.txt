A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are running the Docker application and that have been configured to join together in a cluster.
The activities of the cluster are controlled by a swarm manager, and machines that have joined the cluster are referred to as nodes.

Node is master
Worker is slave

Formula to calculate number of master is
master = (node-1)/2

worker uses token to communicate to master. Communication uses TLS and Certificate authority\
you can create custom nodes for == or != conditions for workers
Docker swarm do not provide load balancing


docker swarm leave // to leave a worker from cluster. Works fon worker


// Master commands
docker swarm init // to make a master 
docker node ls //  to list all available nodes and worker. will work on master
docker swarm join-token [worker|manager] // To get token for master or worker
docker node rm <hostname or id> // master will remove it from cluster
docker node inspect <name>
docker node promote <name> //  To make worker as master
docker node demote  <name> // To make master to worker
docker service ls
docker service rm <service_id>

docker stack // like docker-compose but for cluster
docker events // to check logs for docker-swarm
